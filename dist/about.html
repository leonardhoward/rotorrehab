                <p>Hi, we are Rotor <span class="red">RE</span>-hab and we are rotary engine addicts. </p>
                <p> We too have struggled with rotary engine problems for many years.
                     We have been through all the ups and downs, from the high you get when you cut your fastest lap time
                    , to the pain you feel when your engine just won't work right. We have lost friends because of late nights in the garage trying to feed the rotor addiction.
                     We have gained many friends in search of that rush when the turbo kicks in. </p> 
                <p>We have suffered engine failure so you don't have to.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to help rotary engines reach their full potential. We welcome, with open arms, any engine that has been abused, neglected, and those that seek more power.
                    We want to ensure that every chassis that carries these amazing engines can do so to the best of its abilities.
                    We want to make sure that no one feels the pain of rotor <span class="red">RE</span>-lapse.</p>
                <p> Because every engine needs a helping hand.</p>
                <!-- <p>Paul and Brian have an addiction to the rotary engine. Having personally owned over 10 Rx-7's of all generations, REPU's and an Rx-2, it is safe to say that they have a problem. After trying everything to beat their rotary addiction, Paul and Brian realized that they will never live boring, piston-filled lives.</p>
                <p>What Paul and Brian have learned from their own struggles with addiction, is that they can use their own experiences to help others struggling with rotary engine problems. Their combined 25 years of rotary engine ownership allowed them to lend a helping hand to many engines in the Southwest. Paul and Brian have rebuilt and modified countless rotary engines ranging from stock, to bridge port, to peripheral port. They have saved many rotary-powered cars from being slow, going to the junkyard, or worst of all, being piston-swapped.</p>
                <p>It is true that not all heroes wear capes.</p> -->
