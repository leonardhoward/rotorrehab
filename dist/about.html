                <p>Some addictions are hard to overcome.</p>

                <p>Paul and Brian have an addiction to the rotary engine. Having personally owned over 10 Rx-7's of all generations, REPU's and an Rx-2, it is safe to say that they have a problem. After trying everything to beat their rotary addiction, Paul and Brian realized that they will never live boring, piston-filled lives.</p>
                <p>What Paul and Brian have learned from their own struggles with addiction, is that they can use their own experiences to help others struggling with rotary engine problems. Their combined 25 years of rotary engine ownership allowed them to lend a helping hand to many engines in the Southwest. Paul and Brian have rebuilt and modified countless rotary engines ranging from stock, to bridge port, to peripheral port. They have saved many rotary-powered cars from being slow, going to the junkyard, or worst of all, being piston-swapped.</p>
                <p>It is true that not all heroes wear capes.</p>
